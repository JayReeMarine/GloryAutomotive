                          <p>To maintain the protection of your warranty as long as you can, it’s required that you bring the vehicle to a reputable mechanic for regularly scheduled servicing.</p>
                          <p>We can provide logbook servicing for all makes and models of petrol, diesel, electric and hybrid vehicles, informing you of any issues in your vehicle and letting you drive away with the peace of mind that comes with an intact warranty.</p>

                          <p>Your brakes are arguably your vehicle’s most important safety feature, often making the difference between an emergency stop and an expensive trip to the panel beaters.</p>
                          <p>Your brakes also suffer the most wear and tear of any area in your vehicle, especially with the stop-and-start nature of city driving. Regular checks of the condition of your brakes are important to make sure you’re safe on the road.</p>
                          <p>We offer a range of brake services for all makes and models of vehicles, including replacement and restoration of brake pads, discs and drums, as well as machining of new parts.</p>

                          <p>Keeping your engine cool is essential to maintaining a healthy vehicle. On the other hand, an overheating engine can potentially lead to a crippling and inconvenient breakdown.</p>
                          <p>If you think your vehicle might be overheating, the best thing to do is either pull over immediately or drive very carefully to your nearest workshop for an inspection of your cooling system.</p>
                          <p>We’re able to provide a host of services to your cooling system, from leak checks to replacement of faulty hosing, seals or radiator units, as well as repair damaged gasket heads.</p>

                          <p>Particularly in Australia’s summer months, having an air conditioning system ready to keep you and your passengers cool on the road is vital to driver and passenger comfort.</p>
                          <p>Often your aircon can go neglected, however, and most of the damage is caused not by wear and tear but by disuse through the cooler months, causing cracks and leaks in your system’s hosing.</p>
                          <p>We’ll get your aircon back in working order, from replacing cracked and leaking hosing to repairing air conditioning units and compressors.</p>
                          <p>We’ll also re-gas your system with the refrigerants it needs to keep your vehicle cool all summer long, all in accordance with ARC guidelines.</p>
